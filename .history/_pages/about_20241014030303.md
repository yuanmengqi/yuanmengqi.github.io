Hi, I'm Mengqi Yuan, an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at University of Science and Technology of China. I am currently an intern student in [Secure Learning Lab (UIUC &amp; UChicago)](https://aisecure.github.io/GROUP/index.html), advised by [Prof. Bo Li](https://aisecure.github.io/). Previously, I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Fuli Feng](https://fulifeng.github.io/) in [Lab for Data Science (USTC)](https://data-science.ustc.edu.cn/_upload/tpl/14/fe/5374/template5374/tour.html).

My current research interests lie in improving the generative ability, reliability, and trustworthiness of ML models (such as LLMs and VLMs), and my work also closely relates to agents, focusing on both theoretical and applied aspects.

I will be attending EMNLP 2024 in Miami. If you are interested in my work or related topics, please feel free to reach out for a chat!
